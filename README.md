# MapleTA question importer

__This feature currently only has minimal functionality.__

The intention is to work towards creating an importer as individuals bring libraries of questions for import.  The current intention is not to create a fully featured importer.  In any case, this is likely to be impossible as there are mutually incompatible features between the two systems.  At best, we can import questions placing corresponding fields in the correct places pending editing by an intelligent human.  This will, at least, save significant tedious cut and paste.  If you need this functionality please contact the STACK developers for more information.

This Moodle question import format can import questions exported from a MapleTA system into Moodle with STACK 3.0 installed (https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/). 

It was created by Chris Sangwin.

To install, either [download the zip file](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qformat_mapleta/zipball/master),
unzip it, and place it in the directory `moodle\question\format\mapleta`.
(You will need to rename the directory `moodle-qformat_mapleta -> mapleta`.)
Alternatively, get the code using git by running the following command in the
top level folder of your Moodle install:

    git clone git://github.com/maths/moodle-qformat_mapleta.git question/format/mapleta
